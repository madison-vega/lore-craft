# lore-craft

## Description

As gamers, sometimes we may get so caught up in gameplay mechanics that we don't realize the amount of time and creativity developers put in to create the amazing worlds our player characters live in and the storylines they follow.  With our website we make it a one stop shop to immerse yourelf in the background and lore of your favorite game.  We provide information about many different aspects of the game.  You can even add your own player character to your list and add their backstory and lore as well!
